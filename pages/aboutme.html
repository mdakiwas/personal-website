                <span class="textstroke-yellow">Hello!</span> I am Marlette Jessa Dakiwas, a Filipino-American student attending the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
                I am a senior studying Information Science and New Media Communication, with a minor in Chinese.
                I am a Carolina Covenant, Road to Hire, and Project One scholar.

            <img src="../Graphics/seasa.jpg" alt="SEASA Cultural Wear event" id="img2">
            <p id="p2">Outside the classroom, I am a Design Executive of UNC-CH Southeast Asian Student Association and a two-year
                Gaming Assistant under UNC-CH's Gaming Arena.
                I volunteer in the Carolina Covenant office as a Covenant Connector, ensuring to connect fellow Covenant
                scholars to valued campus and program resources.</p>
            <p id="p3">Additionally, I am a Road to Hire Campus Student Ambassador tasked with assisting in the smooth transition into
                college of UNC-CH students under the Road to Hire Program. My roots as an immigrant, first-generation, and Title-1 student has impassioned me to advocate for student
                equity and in helping students like myself in achieving their best selves in college and beyond.</p>

            <p id="p4">Outside of academics, I am a family and friends-oriented person and love to hangout with my family and friends! Some hobbies I enjoy are going to the gym, drawing, crocheting, and reading.
                I'm every much a home-body and enjoy the indoors, but I love to hike through nature trails and go to scenic landscapes.</p>
